        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish renowned for its rich layers of flavor and comforting, hearty appeal.
            At its core, it is a baked pasta casserole composed of sheets of wide, flat noodles, typically 
            layered with a triumphant trio of ingredients: pasta, rich meat sauce, and creamy béchamel. 
            The foundation of lasagna lies in the meticulous assembly of these layers, creating a harmonious
            blend of textures and tastes. The pasta sheets, either store-bought or homemade, act as the sturdy
            canvas that absorbs the savory goodness. The meat sauce, often a robust combination of ground 
            beef, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs, infuses each layer with a savory depth. Meanwhile, 
            the velvety béchamel sauce, crafted from butter, flour, and milk, adds a luscious creaminess 
            that binds the elements together. This culinary masterpiece is then baked to perfection,
            resulting in a golden-brown crust that conceals the tantalizing medley of 
            flavors within.

            Each forkful of lasagna is a symphony of textures and tastes – the tender 
            pasta yielding to the savory meat sauce, and the creamy béchamel providing a luxurious
            contrast. The dish is often finished with a generous layer of melted cheese on top,
            creating a gooey, golden crown that adds a final layer of indulgence. Whether enjoyed
            as a comforting family dinner or the star attraction at a festive gathering, lasagna
            remains a timeless classic that continues to captivate taste buds around the world.
